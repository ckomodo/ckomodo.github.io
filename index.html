        <h2 id="berry-fm">Blueberry farm!</h2>
        <p> Originally established in the 1940s, the Larsen Lake Blueberry Farm is owned and managed by the Bellevue Parks & Community Services Department to help preserve Bellevueâ€™s agricultural heritage. The farm provides a pastoral setting for park access and seasonal U-pick opportunities.</p>

<p>Larsen Lake Blueberry Farm carries a wide variety of fresh seasonal produce, cut flowers and other agricultural products. Over-the-counter blueberries and other fresh produce can also be purchased at the Lake Hills Farm Fresh Produce Stand.</p>

<P>People can usually come pick blueberries from mid-July to early September, however, the season varies with climate conditions. Blueberry picking is only permitted in designated areas during sales stand operating hours. Please bring valid picture identification as a deposit for picking buckets, and remember to check in with the produce stand upon arrival.</p>
        
        <p>I'm usually very good with getting my way around new places so imagine my disappointment when <strong>I got lost in this thick maze of blueberries and circled around this one spot for 35 minutes</strong> before I finally made my way back to the main entry of the farm. It's a good place to visit either by yourself if you're looking for some lone time, or even with your family and friends and see how many buckets you can fill with blueberries and how fast</p>

        <h2 id="kbel"> KCLS - Bellevue</h2>
        <p>In 1925, the Bellevue Women's Club establishes the first Bellevue Library but it wasn't until 1944 that The King County Library System became responsible for the library's collections and operations.</p>
        <p>The current Bellevue Library was opened in 1993. It covers 80,000 square feet and is <strong>the largest</strong> King County Library Services library. There are 4 rows of public computers, 2 printer and one scanner. This is an addition to tens of shelves of books, audio books, CDs, cassettes and video cassettes. <br>The environment is clean, learner-friendly and quiet. I'll definitely be back often.</p>

        <h2 id="cr-ml"> Crossroads Mall</h2>
        <p>Crossroads Shopping Center is a one-of-a-kind shopping, dining, and entertainment destination with 40 acres of fun including: an eclectic mix of shops, 30 international restaurants, a performance stage featuring live music every weekend, an 8-screen cinema, vintage kids' rides, a farmers market, a public library, spa, health & beauty services, the <strong>Pacific Northwest's largest climbing gym</strong>and much more</p>
        <p>Free live music performances are hosted at the Crossroads Market Stage every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, as well as a variety of community events including cultural festivals, community resources, and a Farmers Market.</p>
        <p>I saw my reflection on a window outside a store here and I didn't like the way I looked, coincidentally, I was standing right outside Crunch Fitness. So I immediatley enrolled a membership and now this is my favorite spot in the whole mall!</p>
